Efficient and Secure Mobile Cloud Computing Framework

This Java-based framework addresses smartphone limitations like short battery life, limited computation power, and small memory by offloading intensive tasks to the cloud. It uses an optimization model to dynamically decide offloading based on energy consumption, CPU utilization, execution time, and memory usage. A built-in security layer ensures data protection during cloud transfer, offering significant performance improvements over existing techniques.
